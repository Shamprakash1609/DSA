I’m applying for this Software Developer role because it aligns directly with the kinds of problems I enjoy solving and the technical path I’m building toward. My background is practical — I’ve spent a lot of time strengthening core programming fundamentals in Java (OOP, data structures, algorithms) through hands-on practice on LeetCode — and I’ve applied those fundamentals while building backend systems using Node.js. That combination of algorithmic thinking + backend experience is what I want to bring to a development team.Concrete work I’ve done shows where my interests lie. I built a telepresence robot controller that supports real-time control and <100ms latency, which taught me about low-latency systems, telemetry, and robust communication (WebSockets, ROS). I also created a MERN movie app used in tests by 100+ users to search a dataset of 500K+ movies and optimized MongoDB queries to cut response time by 50% — practical experience in API design, performance tuning, and scaling. More recently, I built an AI assistant for PDFs (LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI) that handles 200+ page documents with high accuracy, which deepened my interest in applying ML/AI tooling to product problems.This role appeals because it offers the chance to work on production systems where performance, reliability, and clean design matter — exactly the areas I’ve been focusing on. I’m particularly motivated by opportunities to design scalable APIs, optimize data workflows, and contribute to end-to-end features that users actually use. I’m also keen to grow toward enterprise Java backends; I understand Spring Boot at a high level and plan to transition more of my backend work to Java, leveraging my current knowledge and quick learning proven by my project work and competitive problem solving.Finally, I enjoy collaborative environments (hackathons, team projects) and want a place where I can learn from experienced engineers while contributing immediately. In short: this role matches my technical strengths, my recent project experience, and my goal to build scalable, reliable backend systems — and I’m excited to grow into it.
