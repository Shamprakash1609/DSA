4️⃣ General Rule

Whenever you see “minimum number of groups/containers/rounds required”, it’s usually:

ceil (items /capacity) = (items + capacity − 1) / capacity



Common uses:

Number of pages to print (ceil(words / words_per_page))

Number of packets to send (ceil(data / packet_size))

Number of rows in a grid (ceil(elements / columns))

Number of buses/trips (ceil(people / capacity))
